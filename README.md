# Charlie: A Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes AI Partner

## Development Notes
Speech detection incorporates pocketsphinx-ruby, a Ruby wrapper for CMUSphinx by Carnegie Mellon University.

Text-to-speech incorporates espeak.

## Installation

Regardless of your operating system, you'll need your ruby environment set up first. Specifically, you'll need Ruby, rbenv, and Bundler ```gem install bundler```.

### OSX
Install homebrew.
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Install rbenv. ```brew install rbenv```

Install bundler. ```gem install bundler```

Next, install pocketsphinx-ruby's dependencies for voice recognition. (More detailed instructions here: https://github.com/watsonbox/pocketsphinx-ruby#installation)
```
$ brew tap watsonbox/cmu-sphinx
$ brew install --HEAD watsonbox/cmu-sphinx/cmu-sphinxbase
$ brew install --HEAD watsonbox/cmu-sphinx/cmu-pocketsphinx
```

Next, install espeak.
```
$ brew install espeak
```

Next, make sure that homebrew has linked the 'portaudio' keg. Run ```brew doctor``` and check for this error:
```
Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar
Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on
those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:
    portaudio
```
If you see this error, run ```brew link portaudio``` to fix it.

Finally, navigate to the ktane_voice folder and run the following command:
```
$ bundle
```

You should now be able to launch Charlie.
```
$ ruby charlie.rb
```

### Windows (Untested)
Download and install Pocketsphinx, Sphinxbase, and Espeak from the 3 links below.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/5prealpha/
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxbase/5prealpha/
http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html

Then, navigate to the ktane_voice folder and run the following command:
```
$ bundle
```

You should now be able to launch Charlie.
```
$ ruby charlie.rb
```

Have fun!! Please leave issue tickets if these instructions don't work for you! :)

## Modules
Each module has a keyword to select it from the main menu, then commands that will give the bot the appropriate data to solve the module.

The bomb will prompt you for bomb variables the first time that they're necessary. It's recommended when playing expert bombs, however, to say "charlie bomb check" at the beginning of the game to get them all out of the way.

If Charlie isn't responding accurately, TURN DOWN YOUR MIC SENSITIVITY. Currently, Charlie is really sensitive to background noise and static. He doesn't like those at all.
